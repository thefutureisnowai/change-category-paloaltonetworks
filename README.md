Appealing to Palo Alto to change https://securecomputer.ai/ category

Hello, I am Seth Lindberg Briney, the owner of The Future is Now AI, LLC. I respectfully request that https://securecomputer.ai/ be removed from the Greyware category and placed in Business and Economy, and Computer-and-Internet‑info.
https://securecomputer.ai/ offers commercial technology services, providing cybersecurity and AI consulting through static informational pages. It fits under both Business and Economy and Computer-and-Internet‑info categories per Palo Alto definitions

You can find on https://secure.dor.wa.gov/ that I have Secure Computer Solutions registered as a trade-name, which is the name I primarily operate under. You can also find The Future is Now AI, LLC listed in https://dor.wa.gov/. I own the domain https://securecomputer.ai/ (which is my primary business site) via GoDaddy. https://securecomputer.ai/ is hosted on GitHub Pages at: https://github.com/thefutureisnowai/thefutureisnowai.github.io. There is no intermediary infrastructure; the DNS CNAME points directly to GitHub’s servers. You can clearly see that there is no "intrusive behavior" in my code, including "attempting the end user to grant remote access or perform other unauthorized actions", or anything illegal. I am not typosquatting, because "Secure Computer" is part of my trade name, and https://securecomputer.ai/ is being actively used, and you can see that it is linked in my professional website https://sethbriney.com/, and in my LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/sethlbriney.

My website is constructed with Jekyll, and has a styles.css. Aside from that, there is no scripting on my website which significantly improves security, and clearly contains no web apps, and no "embedded crypto miners, clickjacking or hijackers that change the elements of the browser.". I do not use Javascript, and my website contains no cookies. I mention that it is possible that GoDaddy and / or GitHub are doing tracking, and I link their privacy policies and encourage clients to read over them. Aside from anything going on between GitHub and GoDaddy, my website is entirely open source, so you can check for yourself: https://github.com/thefutureisnowai/thefutureisnowai.github.io.

One thing of concern to me is that my content security policy (CSP) is not entirely supported by GitHub. My CSP is rather stringent, but is not entirely supported by GitHub. My CSP may be stricter than necessary, but it reflects a cautious security posture. I am considering changing hosts so that my CSP can be entirely enforced.

I hold two master's degrees from WWU, the first in mathematics, the second in computer science. Here are some websites that mention me by name:

If you need any additional information, please let me know. You can reach me at seth@securecomputer.ai, which is hosted by Google Workspace.

I care deeply about the integrity of my business, especially related to cyber security. If there is anything wrong with my website, please let me know so that I can fix it ASAP.
